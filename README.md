Arduino code for an IoT-based heart-rate monitor developed using an Easy Pulse Sensor HRM 2511 E, a 0.96" I2C OLED Display and an ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller board.  <br>
Sent all heart-rate data collected to a time-series database on InfluxDB. <br>
Connected the InfluxDB cloud with a Grafana dashboard to display data received in a visual format.
